In this repository [1], PID and FOPID controllers designed for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) have been compared.

First, the transfer function of the relevant plant was obtained using the data from [1] with the Matlab System Identification Toolbox. Subsequently, a comparison of PID and FOPID controllers was conducted in the Matlab environment.

Finally, experimental results for PID and FOPID were obtained for the the plant using Matlab Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) technique.

This study has been prepared for the 47th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing.

The contents of this repository are as follows:

-Matlab System Identification file (.sid),
-Matlab code for Approx (.m),
-C source code for the IIR filter(.c).
